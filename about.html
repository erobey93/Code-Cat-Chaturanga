<br>Hi! I'm Emily! I am an aspiring software engineer with a deep passion for psychology. I have a BS in psychology and social science with a focus on Attachment theory, specifically in non-traditional environments such as the workplace and school. I had intended to pursue a PhD in clinical psychology, but due to a plethora of reasons my path changed. After graduating with my first degree I took a year to work and collect myself. I used this time to explore other career options which included attending a very short coding boot camp. Empowered and excited by the boot camp and inspired by a few good friends I decided to pursue a path that has always intrigued me: software engineering.
<!--<br><br>Outside of my academic ventures I enjoy long distance backpacking (OCT 19/20, CCT 19), hiking, traveling, swimming, cycling, urban adventures (especially with my dog and best friend Marvin), Vipassana meditation, yoga, witchcraft, cooking healthy vegan meals, reading, writing, blogging, learning about new topics and making lists.
-->
<br><br>Given my perpetually curious nature I couldn't help but want to further explore all of the concepts that I am learning as I complete my BS in Software Engineering while further understanding the crossover between psychology and software engineering. In addition to discussing topics pertaining to software engineering, psychology and other cross-over disciplines I wanted to build a website from scratch while possibly connecting with other people on similar journeys. I've been blogging and building websites (from templates mostly) since I was young and writing has always been a natural extensions of understanding, processing and sharing my world, so building a website and blog was the perfect outlet for me! All in all, I don't have any big end goals and I'm not doing this for anyone else. I just wanted my own little corner on the web to build, learn and document it all.
